Go to https://code.thumby.us and check to see if this game is in the arcade or not, if it isnt then follow these steps!

1: Download all the files here that are json and py files!

2: In the code editor on the page, make sure to set each file name that corresponds to the file as the destination area like so:

File locations:
  
	/Games/th-umb/th-umb.py
  
	/Games/th-umb/crafting.py
  
	/Games/th-umb/gameLogic.py
  
	/Games/th-umb/sprites.py
  
	/Games/th-umb/worldGen.py
  
	/Games/th-umb/sl.py

	/Games/th-umb/pSave.json
  
	/Games/th-umb/worlds.json
  
	/Games/th-umb/thumbyGrayscale.py

3: Make sure all of the games have the white checkmark boxed out and that th-umb.py has both marked before playing!
